(Work-in-progress)

This is a proof-of-concept for a way to modernize the existing website for FAULTLINE, a literary magazine I co-edited in graduate school. Here is the existing site, for reference: https://faultline.sites.uci.edu/

I used WordPress as a headless CMS and built a custom, responsive frontend in Next.js, with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS. The frontend is populated by WordPress with GraphQL.

# To build
`npm install`
`npm run dev`

# Deployment
Deployed on [Vercel](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/deploying#managed-nextjs-with-vercel)
